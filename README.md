# Smoke Detection Machine Learning App

A real-time fire alarm prediction system built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **scikit-learn**.
This app uses sensor data to classify whether a **fire is detected (1)** or **not (0)** based on environmental features.

## Features

- Binary classification: `Fire Detected (1)` or `No Fire (0)`
- Real-time prediction UI using **Streamlit**
- Data pre-processing with Label Encoding and StandardScaler
- Model persistence using `joblib`
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)
- Supports `.csv` files with minimal pre-configuration
